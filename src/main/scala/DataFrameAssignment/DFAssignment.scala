    * In this exercise we want to know all the commit SHA's from a list of committers. We require these to be
    * ordered according to their timestamps in the following format:
    *
    * | committer      | sha                                      | timestamp            |

    * Hint: Try to work out the individual stages of the exercises. This makes it easier to track bugs, and figure out

    * function to take a look at the structure and contents of the DataFrames.
